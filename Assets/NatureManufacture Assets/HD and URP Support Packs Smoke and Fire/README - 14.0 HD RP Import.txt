BEFORE YOU START:
- you need Unity 2022.3+
- you need HD SRP pipline 14.0 or higher
- there is wind prefab which will manage wind at your scene
Be patient HD RP tech is so fluid... we coudn't follow every beta version

Step 1 - Import our HD RP 14.0 Unity 2022.3 Fire and Smoke compatibility pack
Step 2 - Render setup.
- !!!! IMPORTANT !!!! Open "Project settings" ->"Gaphics"-> "HDRP global settings" ->  "Diffusion Profile Assets"
		  NM_SSSSettings_Smoke
	Without this smoke materials will not become affected by scattering and they will look wrong.
